				<p class="lead">Arachnid and Myriapod collections at the American Museum of Natural History</p>
				<h2 class="more-space-before">Personnel</h2>
				<p>In 2002, <a href="https://www.amnh.org/research/staff-directory/lorenzo-prendini" target="_blank">Lorenzo
					Prendini</a> was hired to curate the Arachnid (non-spider) and Myriapod Collections in the
				<a href="https://research.amnh.org/invertzoo" target="_blank">Division of Invertebrate Zoology</a> at the American Museum of Natural History. The following
				arachnid orders fall
				under his jurisdiction: Acari (mites and ticks), Amblypygi (whip spiders), Opiliones (harvestmen), Palpigradi
				(palpigrades), Pseudoscorpiones (false scorpions), Schizomida (schizomids), Scorpiones (scorpions), Solifugae
				(solifuges, solpugids or camel-spiders), Uropygi (vinegaroons or whip scorpions). 
				<p>Upon the retirement of Norman
					I. Platnick in 2014, Prendini assumed responsibility for the Araneae (spiders) and Ricinulei (hooded
					tick-spiders or ricinuleids). Queries regarding visits, loan requests, and/or specimen donations concerning any
					of these groups should be addressed to him.</p>
				<p>In addition, Prendini is in charge of the myriapod orders Chilopoda (centipedes), Diplopoda (millipedes),
					Pauropoda (pauropods),
					and Symphyla (garden centipedes or symphylans). Pio Colmenares, Museum Specialist, is responsible for management
					of the Arachnid (non-Araneae) and Myriapod Collections, and for processing loan requests.
					Due to Lou Sorkin's retirement, all loan requests directed to the Spider and Ricinuleid Collections may suffer
					significant delays. More information
					about the personnel in Prendini's research group can be found under the <a href="../people/people.html">People</a> section.</p>

				<h2>Use of Collections</h2>
				<div align="justify">Incoming and outgoing loans of specimens from the Arachnid and Myriapod Collections are a
					weekly occurrence,
					while visits to the collections occur less frequently, averaging once a month. Queries regarding visits, loan
					requests, specimen
					donations, and the preservation of tissue samples for molecular analysis should be addressed
					to <a href="../people/principal-investigator/principal-investigator.html">Lorenzo Prendini</a>. Anyone
					interested in the particular protocols used for the preservation
					and management of the AMNH Arachnid and Myriapod Collections should contact <a
						href="../people/staff/staff.html">Pio Colmenares</a>.
					Donors should refer to the Division of Invertebrate
					Zoology <a
						href="https://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/policies/collecting-deposition-fish-and-wildlife-policies">instructions</a>
					for depositing material. Those interested
					in management of natural history collections should consult the website for the <a
						href="http://www.spnhc.org">Society for the
						Preservation of Natural History Collections</a> (SPNHC).</div>
				<a id="loan-requests"></a>
				<h2>Loan Requests</h2>
				<div align="justify">If you would like to apply for a loan, please complete the following form so we can consider
					your request.

				<h2>Coronavirus Pandemic Update</h2>
				<div>
					<p>We regret to inform that due to economic austerity, including loss of collections support staff, associated with the
					COVID-19 pandemic, loans from the AMNH Collections of Arachnida and Myriapoda will be drastically curtailed for the
					foreseeable future. Scientists remain welcome to visit the collections to study material, once the AMNH has reopened
					and it is safe to do so, and limited funding sources are available to support that:
