				<h1>Tissue Collections</h1>
				<p class="lead more-space-before">As part of our research on the molecular systematics of scorpions, a synoptic collection of
					scorpion tissues, comprising ca. 2000 tissue samples and associated vouchers (nearly a quarter of all described
					scorpion species and half of all described genera) has accumulated through fieldwork and donations or exchanges with
					colleagues around the world.</p>
				<h6>The Collection</h6>
				<p>The collection is continually augmented and includes sizable holdings of tissue samples
					from Araneae (for the ATOL Spider Phylogeny project), Amblypygi, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Opiliones, Palpigradi,
					Ricinulei, Schizomida, Solifugae and Uropygi, in addition to Scorpiones. Among other countries, this material
					originates from Argentina, Australia, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, Dominican Republic, France,
					French Guiana, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Israel,
					Italy, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Martinique, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, New Caledonia, New Guinea,
					New Zealand, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Senegal, Seychelles, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey,
					South Africa, Uruguay, the U.S.A., Uzbekistan, and Yemen. These collections are currently being stored at -20ºC in
					large freezers in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology and will eventually be transferred to the <a
					href="https://www.amnh.org/our-research/sackler-institute-for-comparative-genomics/facilities/amcc" target="_blank">Ambrose
					Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research</a> of the AMNH for permanent storage.</p>

				<h2>Preparing Tissue Samples</h2>
				<h6>Tissue samples</h6>
				<p>If refrigeration facilities are available, place each specimen into a separate container of
					95-100% ethanol (preferably analytical grade), and place this directly into the freezer (-20ºC). Ensure that the
					volume of ethanol in the vessel containing each specimen is at least five times the volume of the specimen. Leave
					the specimens in the freezer for at least 7 days before dispatching. Replace the (now diluted) ethanol before
					dispatching.</p>
				<p>If refrigeration facilities are unavailable, place each specimen into a separate container of 95-100% ethanol
					(preferably analytical grade) and keep as cool as possible. If specimens are large and/or heavily sclerotized,
					remove a leg(s) from one side of the specimen and place into a small vial of 95-100% ethanol. Then inject the
					specimen, or make an incision, allowing the ethanol to diffuse into the tissues. Use a sterile scalpel or needle for
					each dissection/injection, and clean forceps in ethanol after each dissection. Place the specimen in a large vessel
					containing at least five times the volume of the specimen. Replace the ethanol in each container within 24 to 48
					hours, and thereafter if it appears discolored. Larger samples may require ethanol to be replaced several times.
					Make sure to use labels to associate the vial with the larger vessel.</p>

				<h6>Vouchers</h6>
				<p>If intact specimens are used as vouchers, preserve these appropriately for morphological
					examination. If genitalia are used as vouchers, they must be dissected by the individual submitting the sample to
					the AMNH and placed in a microvial within the same vial as the tissue sample or in a separate, clearly labelled
					vial.</p>

				</figure>
				<h6>Documentation and archiving</h6>
				<p>All specimens and tissue samples must contain a label, indicating the following
					provenance data: country, state, region or province, district or county, locality, geographical coordinates (degrees
					and minutes or decimal degrees), collector, date, habitat, collection method. Labels should be typed, printed or
					legibly written in indelible ink.</p>
				<p>All specimens and tissue samples must be authoritatively identified, preferably to species (if possible) and sexed,
					with indication whether or not the specimen is adult. If available, the species identification (including authority
					and date) and sex, as well as the name of the individual responsible for the identification may appear on a separate
					label in the vial with the specimen/tissue sample. Provenance data and identifications appearing on labels may also
					be sent to the AMNH in a spreadsheet.</p>
