books and bound journals, as well as electronic and microform materials essential to the scientific, exhibition 
and educational missions of the AMNH. The library currently receives more than 4,360 journals from sources worldwide. 
The library is one of the best in the USA for biosystematic studies and contains a range of periodicals relevant to 
systematics and phylogenetics in general, as well as journals relevant to taxonomic groups under study by AMNH 
researchers. The library also contains an extensive collection of old literature, essential for nomenclatural purposes. 
AMNH staff, visiting researchers, postdoctoral fellows, students, and volunteers have ready access to the library 
collections and to varied services offered by library staff, from reference and bibliographic assistance to interlibrary 
loans.</div>

<br /><br />
<b>Southwestern Research Station (SWRS)</b> 
<br />
<div align="justify">The <a href="https://research.amnh.org/swrs">SWRS</a> is a biological field station owned and operated by the AMNH. 
Since 1955, it has served biologists, geologists, and anthropologists interested in studying the diverse 
environments and biota of the Chiricahua Mountains in southeastern Arizona. The Station welcomes scientists and 
advanced students from all parts of the USA and abroad to carry out their research projects. Investigators live in 
comfortable cabins provided with linens and blankets, and take their meals, cafeteria-style, in a common dining 
room. The main house contains a dining room, library, lounge with fireplace, ping-pong room, and laundry room. 
Outside is a large swimming pool, volleyball court, and horseshoe pit. The area is laced with trails for hiking and 
climbing amongst spectacular scenery. The Station is open all year but scientists must cook for themselves from 
early November through early March. Facilities in the Osborn Memorial Laboratory include library, insect collection, 
herbarium, vertebrate collections, photography laboratory, etc. Completed in 1992, the Technical Equipment 
Laboratory provides excellent microscopic facilities, constant temperature chambers, chemical hood, low-temperature 
freezer, precision balances, centrifuges, etc. Recent additions of outdoor aviary complexes and an Animal Behavior 
Observatory afford outstanding facilities for ethological and behavioral ecological studies.</div>
