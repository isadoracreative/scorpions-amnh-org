				<h6>Remote Sensing & GIS Laboratory</h6>
				<p>A Remote Sensing and GIS laboratory, with UNIX workstations, digitizers and site licenses for ArcView GIS, ARC/INFO, and ArcUSA, 
					is available at the <a href="https://cbc.amnh.org" target="_blank">Center for Biodiversity and Conservation</a> (CBC). The CBC 
					has also produced a <a href="https://www.amnh.org/our-research/center-for-biodiversity-conservation/biodiversity-informatics" target="_blank">website</a> to promote the use of remotely sensed 
					imagery (such as satellite imagery and aerial photography). The site provides remote sensing guides to locate, 
					download, and view satellite imagery; material and information for remote sensing training courses and 
					workshops offered by the CBC and other organizations; interactive tools to illustrate fundamental remote 
					sensing concepts; and links to an array of remote sensing information available on the Internet.</p>

					books and bound journals, as well as electronic and microform materials essential to the scientific, exhibition 
					and educational missions of the AMNH. The library currently receives more than 4,360 journals from sources worldwide. 
					The library is one of the best in the USA for biosystematic studies and contains a range of periodicals relevant to 
					systematics and phylogenetics in general, as well as journals relevant to taxonomic groups under study by AMNH 
					researchers. The library also contains an extensive collection of old literature, essential for nomenclatural purposes. 
					AMNH staff, visiting researchers, postdoctoral fellows, students, and volunteers have ready access to the library 
					collections and to varied services offered by library staff, from reference and bibliographic assistance to interlibrary 
					loans.</p>

				<h6>Southwestern Research Station (SWRS)</h6>
				<p>The <a href="https://research.amnh.org/swrs" target="_blank">SWRS</a> is a biological field station owned and operated by the AMNH. 
					Since 1955, it has served biologists, geologists, and anthropologists interested in studying the diverse 
					environments and biota of the Chiricahua Mountains in southeastern Arizona. The Station welcomes scientists and 
					advanced students from all parts of the USA and abroad to carry out their research projects. Investigators live in 
					comfortable cabins provided with linens and blankets, and take their meals, cafeteria-style, in a common dining 
					room. The main house contains a dining room, library, lounge with fireplace, ping-pong room, and laundry room. 
					Outside is a large swimming pool, volleyball court, and horseshoe pit. The area is laced with trails for hiking and 
					climbing amongst spectacular scenery. The Station is open all year but scientists must cook for themselves from 
					early November through early March. Facilities in the Osborn Memorial Laboratory include library, insect collection, 
					herbarium, vertebrate collections, photography laboratory, etc. Completed in 1992, the Technical Equipment 
					Laboratory provides excellent microscopic facilities, constant temperature chambers, chemical hood, low-temperature 
					freezer, precision balances, centrifuges, etc. Recent additions of outdoor aviary complexes and an Animal Behavior 
					Observatory afford outstanding facilities for ethological and behavioral ecological studies.</p>
