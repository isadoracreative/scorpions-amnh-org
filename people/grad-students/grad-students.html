				<h1>Graduate Students</h1>
				<p class="lead">Several graduate students worked in the Arachnology lab in past years. These students were funded from various sources including grants from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a> and the AMNH (graduate student fellowships and the Comparative Biology Program of the Richard Gilder Graduate School). If you are interested graduate study in the Arachnology lab, please visit the website of the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/our-research/richard-gilder-graduate-school">Richard Gilder Graduate School</a> to apply to the RGGS for a graduate student fellowship for study at a partner programs (e.g., City University of New York).</p>

						<h6>City University of New York</h6>
						<p class="small">Graduate student in 2016</p>
						<p>Jayson Slovak graduated with a BA in Biology from Queens College, CUNY. During his undergraduate studies he worked under Dr. Stephane Boissinot to see how population size affected abundance of Transposable Elements in the Threespine Stickleback. During his leap year he accompanied an expedition with Dr. Boissinot to Ethiopia to frog collect samples for his lab. He is currently a master student from City College working under Dr. Lorenzo Prendini since June 2016. His work will involve studying how the Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia affects Scorpion distribution and speciation in the region.</p>

						<h6>Richard Gilder Graduate School, American Museum of Natural History</h6>
						<p class="small">Graduate student from 2011 to 2016</p>
						<p>Stephanie first came to the AMNH as a high school student participating in the High School Science Research Program of the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation with Felicity Arengo. In 2011, she completed her B.S. at Sewanee University in TN. During her B.S. she spent a summer working at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago as an NSF REU intern studying the evolution and biogeography of the Malagasy giant pill-millipedes, genus <i>Sphaeromimus</i>, under the guidance of Thomas Wesener and Petra Sierwald. Stephanie entered the Comparative Biology PhD program at the AMNH Richard Gilder Graduate School in 2011 and graduated in 2015. Her dissertation focused on the evolution and biogeography of Southeast Asian scorpions, particularly the family Chaerilidae.</p>

						<p>Tharina holds six degrees including two B.S. degrees, a Masters and a Higher Education Diploma from the University of Pretoria, South Africa. She was funded in part for a PhD at Colorado State University, by a National Science Foundation Biodiversity Surveys and Inventories grant to Paula Cushing and Lorenzo Prendini, graduating in 2014. Tharina visited the AMNH on several occasions to study and image the extensive camel spider collection for her dissertation research on the cheliceral morphology of Solifugae and worked extensively with Prendini. She then returned to the National Museum of Namibia, Windhoek.</p>

						<p>Lionel completed a B.Sc. at the University of Geneva and an MSc revising the systematics of <i>Liocheles</i> scorpions at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, graduating in 2000. Monod subsequently worked at the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, Geneva. He visited the AMNH to work in the collections and Molecular Systematics Laboratory in November-December 2002 and, in 2005, Monod was awarded a Graduate Student Fellowship from the AMNH to conduct a PhD thesis on the systematics and biogeography of Indo-Pacific liochelid scorpions, via the PhD program in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, City University of New York. He completed his PhD in 2011 and now works as a Research Officer at the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, Geneva.</p>
