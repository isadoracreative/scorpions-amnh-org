				<h1>Graduate Students</h1>
				<p class="lead">Several graduate students worked in the Arachnology lab in past years. These students were funded from various sources including grants from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a> and the AMNH (graduate student fellowships and the Comparative Biology Program of the Richard Gilder Graduate School). If you are interested graduate study in the Arachnology lab, please visit the website of the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/our-research/richard-gilder-graduate-school">Richard Gilder Graduate School</a> to apply to the RGGS for a graduate student fellowship for study at a partner programs (e.g., City University of New York).</p>

						<p>Ricardo completed his Biology B.S. at Javeriana University in Bogota. While an undergraduate student, he became interested in arachnids and started working on scorpions from his native country, Colombia. Gradually, hooded thick-spiders (order Ricinulei) and sun-spiders (order Solifugae) became part of his research interests. After a 5-year period working in the pharmaceutical industry, Ricardo moved to Argentina to undertake doctoral studies at the Buenos Aires University. There, he conducted his research at the Division of Arachnology of the Argentinian Museum of Natural Sciences Bernardino Rivadavia. His Ph.D. thesis consisted of a taxonomic revision and phylogenetic analysis of the South American solifuge family Mummuciidae. In 2016, Ricardo visited the AMNH collections, supported by a Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Grant from the AMNH and a Vincent Roth Grant for Systematics Research from the American Arachnological Society. Ricardo is currently a Theodore Roosevelt Postdoctoral Research Fellow from the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the AMNH, and is now working on the evolution of Ricinuleids.</p>
