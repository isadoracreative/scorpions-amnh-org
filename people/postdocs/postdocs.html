        <td><div align="justify"> Ricardo completed his Biology B.S. at Javeriana University in Bogot. While an undergraduate student, he became interested in arachnids and started working on scorpions from his native country, Colombia. Gradually, hooded thick-spiders (order Ricinulei) and sun-spiders (order Solifugae) became part of his research interests. After a 5-year period working in the pharmaceutical industry, Ricardo moved to Argentina to undertake doctoral studies at the Buenos Aires University. There, he conducted his research at the Division of Arachnology of the Argentinian Museum of Natural Sciences Bernardino Rivadavia. His Ph.D. thesis consisted of a taxonomic revision and phylogenetic analysis of the South American solifuge family Mummuciidae. In 2016, Ricardo visited the AMNH collections, supported by a Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Grant from the AMNH and a Vincent Roth Grant for Systematics Research from the American Arachnological Society. Ricardo is currently a Theodore Roosevelt Postdoctoral Research Fellow from the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the AMNH, and is now working on the evolution of Ricinuleids. </div>

        <td><div align="justify"> Fred got his Masters degree in molecular and cellular biology from the Philipps University of Marburg, Germany in 2013. In 2019 he obtained his PhD in molecular biosciences from Stockholm University, Sweden for his work investigating how bacteria fulfill the basic cellular need of maintaining a functional proteome. In his research, Frederic has always been keen on comparative approaches that incorporate the evolutionary perspective enabling a broader and functionally relevant understanding of fundamental biological processes. Becoming convinced of the importance of the evolutionary perspective of his research during his PhD, combined with a long-standing passion for arachnids, he began collaborating on arachnological research projects aimed at enhancing the knowledge of Caribbean arachnid diversity. In February of 2020 he joined the AMNH for a six-months short-term postdoctoral research stay. In his research project funded by the German Academic Exchange Service and a Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Grant he investigates the evolution of Mexican whip spiders. </div>

Carsten's Ph.D. thesis was a comprehensive study of the morphology of fully land-adapted book lungs from extant and extinct arachnids. During the course of his post-doctoral research at the AMNH, Carsten examined the Palaeozoic scorpions, testing them for the purported aquatic life. The methodological spectrum he applied for revealing the morphological and anatomical characters, reaches from classical microscopy, through electron microscopy, to cutting-edge microtomographical techniques.</div>
