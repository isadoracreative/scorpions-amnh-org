						<p class="more-space-before">Pío is an arachnologist with experience in taxonomy and ecology. His main research interests are
							the taxonomy, systematics, ecology, conservation and biogeography of Opiliones. In addition to working with
							Opiliones, he also has experience in the taxonomy of other arachnid orders, such as Amblypygi, Schizomida,
							Solifugae, and spiders of the family Pholcidae. Pío joined the AMNH staff in 2016 and is currently in charge of the
							Arachnid and Myriapod Collections.</p>
						<p>Pío began his studies at the University of Zulia (LUZ) in Maracaibo, Venezuela, where he received his undergraduate
							degree in biology in 2008. During his time as a student, he worked in the Museum of Biology at La Universidad del
							Zulia (MBLUZ). Upon graduating, he started working as a research assistant of the Biodiversity Unit at the Instituto
							Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas (IVIC) in Caracas, Venezuela. In 2009 he studied at the National Museum of
							Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, where he received training in curatorial
							techniques and management of various natural history collections. In 2015, he defended his doctoral thesis on
							Amazonian Harvestmen communities at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA) in Manaus, Brazil.</p>

							San Francisco Art Institute and has worked variously as a carpenter, video maker, artist and
							illustrator. He began full time employment at the AMNH in 1999 as a Scientific Assistant, providing
							illustration, photo and graphic support to the Division of Invertebrate Zoology.</p>

						<h6>Visiting Scientist, New York Entomological Society</h6>
						<figure class="image-person-large">
							<img src="../../images/lou.jpg" alt="Louis Sorkin">
						</figure>
						<p class="more-space-before">Lou began his career in arachnid studies during his graduate work at the University of
							Connecticut where he researched arthropod parasites of spiders. In 1978, Lou began work on spiders and other
							arachnids under Dr. Norman Platnick, in what was then the Department of Entomology at the AMNH. Over the years
							he sorted through many spider collections and labeled thousands of vials and worked with many arachnologists,
							some visiting and examining the museum's collection and sometimes at other institutions during his visits or on
							excursions from arachnology meetings. He deals with many public inquiries regarding insects and other
							arthropods. He has interests in entomophagy and forensic entomology (the latter includes stored products, urban,
							and medico-legal studies). Some of the cases and investigations have been aired online, on television and radio
							and in the print media. At present, some of his studies include investigations of the common bed bug, <i>Cimex 
							lectularius</i> (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) due to the relatively recent increase in infestations of many homes,
							business, hotels, by this insect and for which he receives inquiries on their natural history and biology and
							management. He keeps a few bed bug colonies for study and for educational purposes. After 43 years of dedicated
							service, Lou retired from his position as Museum Specialist for the Spider Collection in early 2020. He will
							remain associated with the AMNH Invertebrate Zoology Division to continue with his outreach activities and the
							organization of the New York Entomological Society.</p>

							collection in the world, with over a million spider specimens, and the arachnological research carried out there
							is among the best in the world, it is an ideal place for Vlad to work.</p>
