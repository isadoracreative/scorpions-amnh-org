				<h1>Why Scorpions?</h1>
				<p class="lead more-space-before">The Arachnology Lab at the AMNH focuses on the taxonomy, phylogeny and biogeography of scorpions and related arachnid
					orders. There are many compelling reasons to study these organisms. Scorpions and their kin are ancient, medically
					important, ecologically, morphologically and taxonomically diverse, and distributed in most terrestrial habitats and
					elevations on all continents except Antarctica. Scorpions inspire fear and fascination. Many species are threatened
					yet little is known about their biology, new species remain to be discovered, and there are few experts globally.
					The world scorpion fauna will remain poorly known until more scorpion specialists are trained and prospects for
					their employment improve.</p>
				<h4>Diversity</h4>
				<p>As listed in the Synopsis of Described Scorpions of the World and the Scorpion Files, approximately 2259 extant
					species in 209 genera and, depending on the authority, between 13 and 20 families (depending on the authority), as
					well as 92 extinct species in 71 genera and 42 families, are recognized in the arachnid order Scorpiones. This is an
					almost fourfold increase in the number of species listed a century ago in Kraepelin's (1899) Revision der Skorpione.
					Although comprising only a small component of arthropod diversity, scorpions are of considerable interest to
					scientist and layman alike.</p>

							document.write('<img src="' + image + '" alt="Image ' + (index + 1) + '" class="image-container-small">');
						});

				<h4 class="more-space-before">Antiquity</h4>
				<p>Scorpions enjoy widespread public appeal (much of it based on fear). Their toxicity, relatively large size and
					fearsome appearance, notwithstanding the great age of their lineage, contribute to a fascination that has always and
					continues to surround them. Among the most ancient arthropods, derived from amphibious ancestors that lived in the
					Silurian, more than 400 million years ago, scorpions have earned the title of 'living fossils'. The scorpion ground
					plan, developed so long ago, is highly successful. Paleozoic scorpions closely resemble their modern descendants in
					basic anatomical details, except that some were considerably larger. <i>Brontoscorpio anglicus</i> measured
					approximately 1 meter in length-an order of magnitude greater than the largest extant <i>Pandinus</i> from tropical
					Africa, which average about 20 cm. Scorpions were formerly considered the sister group of other arachnids because
					they closely resemble extinct marine eurypterids (the sister group of arachnids) but recent data suggest that
					scorpions are embedded in the arachnid lineage, and merely retain primitive features.</p>

				<h4 class="more-space-before">Notoriety</h4>
				<p>Scorpions are notorious worldwide. Scorpion venoms contain multiple low molecular weight proteinaceous neurotoxins
					that block sodium and potassium channels, preventing the transmission of nerve impulses across synapses. In regions
					where scorpion envenomation represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality (e.g. Mexico, North Africa and
					the Middle East), scorpions are justifiably feared. Some 100 000 scorpion stings occur annually in Mexico and as
					many as 800 people (mostly young children and the elderly) die as a result. The figures may be even higher in North
					Africa and the Middle East. Nevertheless, most scorpions are harmless. The sting may be painful, but not dangerous.
					Only about 25 species, all in family Buthidae, are considered medically important worldwide. Most of these occur in
					the New World genera <i>Centruroides</i> and <i>Tityus</i>, and the Old World genera <i>Androctonus</i>,
					<i>Buthus</i>, <i>Leiurus</i>, <i>Mesobuthus</i> and <i>Parabuthus</i>. <i>Centruroides exilicauda</i>, from
					Arizona, California, and New Mexico, is the only species known to be lethal in the U.S.A. The venom of these
					scorpions has proved fatal to healthy children up to 16 years of age and to adults suffering from hypertension and
					general debility.

				<h4 class="more-space-before">Distribution</h4>
				<p>Scorpions occur on all continents except Antarctica, but are most abundant and diverse in tropical and subtropical
					regions. The greatest abundance and diversity of scorpions occurs in desert and semi-desert habitats, but they may
					also be found in savannas and grasslands, in deciduous, coniferous, and tropical rainforests, on high mountain
					slopes (above 5500 m elevation) in the Alps, Himalayas and Andes, in some of the deepest caves (nearly 1 km below
					the surface), and even in the intertidal zone. Although most scorpions are terrestrial, some are arboreal. Favored
					habitats include burrows (up to 1 m deep, to escape hot diurnal temperatures), spaces under tree bark, logs, stones,
					and in rock crevices. Some species adapt well to human environments. Scorpions are often abundant in suitable
					habitat. Densities of 1 per square meter were reported for the Middle Eastern <i>Leiurus quinquestriatus</i> and of
					8-12 per square meter for the intertidal <i>Serradigitus littoralis</i> from Baja California. Given the high
					densities of scorpions in some areas, their importance in ecological food webs, particularly with respect to helping
					control insect populations, is considerable. Many are sensitive to environmental degradation and are considered
					equilibrium species.</p>
				<figure class="image-illustration-large">
					<img src="../images/distribution.jpg" alt="Approximate world distribution of scorpions">
				</figure>
				<h4 class="more-space-before">Ecology</h4>
				<p>Scorpions are primarily nocturnal. All fluoresce under long-wave ultraviolet light, facilitating their collection and
					observation at night. Their simple eyes detect luminosity, but little else. Prey are detected with slit sense organs
					in the tarsi, sensory setae (trichobothria) on the pedipalps, and the pectines, and attacked with the chelate
					pedipalps or venomous sting. Scorpions with slender pedipalps are prone to sting their prey, those with robust
					pedipalps to crush prey mechanically, reserving the sting for large or strong prey. All use the pedipalps to
					manipulate prey, tearing pieces off with the chelicerae to be digested in a pre-oral cavity before being sucked into
					the gut. Scorpions are important consumers in some communities. <i>Scorpio maurus</i> was reported to eat an annual
					average of 11% of the Israeli isopod population, <i>Urodacus yaschenkoi</i> 7.9 kg/ha of invertebrate prey in
					Australia. Cannibalism and predation by other scorpion species may be the most important sources of scorpion
					mortality but other invertebrate predators (e.g. centipedes) and vertebrates are also important predators. Mortality
					is highest immediately after birth, lower for individuals of intermediate age, and high for adults. For example,
					65%, 30%, and 60% per year for the Australian <i>Urodacus manicatus</i>. Mortality is particularly high among males
					due to increased mobility during breeding season and cannibalism by females. Biased adult sex ratios of 1.2-1.4:1
					are typical. Social behavior occurs rarely in species of <i>Heterometrus</i>, <i>Opisthacanthus</i> and
					<i>Pandinus</i>, in which family groups with overlapping generations cooperate to construct and occupy communal
					burrows, inhabited by individuals of various ages.

				</div>
				<h4 class="more-space-before">Life History</h4>
				<p>Scorpions have a remarkable life history. Reproduction in scorpions is indirect. Intromission occurs via a
					spermatophore. The male attaches the spermatophore to the substrate while grasping the female by the pedipalps or
					chelicerae during a mating dance or "promenade-à-deux". The species-specific spermatophore catapults the sperm mass
					into the female gonopore when a lever is touched (a lock-and-key mechanism). Scorpions are unusual among arthropods
					in that all are viviparous-embryos develop in the reproductive tract and receive nourishment from yolk or maternal
					tissues. Some are parthenogenic. More than most other terrestrial arthropods, scorpions resemble large vertebrates
					in life history traits and are considered K-selected. They have very low reproductive rates in comparison to other
					terrestrial arthropods and are among the most long-lived. Gestation times are long (several months to more than a
					year) and litter sizes often small (1-105). Young are fairly large at birth and altricial, clinging to the mother
					for the first few molts before dispersing. Time to sexual maturity varying from 2-8 years, depending on the species.
					Average longevity is around 4 years, but larger species may live 25-30 years. Scorpions do not molt as adults.</p>

				<h4 class="more-space-before">Conservation</h4>
				<p>Urgency for the study of any taxonomic group can be argued on the basis of prevailing ignorance about the world's
					biota. However, scorpions warrant more attention than they receive. As K-selected, equilibrium species, and
					comprising a major group of predatory arthropods in arid ecosystems, scorpions are valuable bio-indicators. Their
					disappearance signals habitat degradation and they represent charismatic 'flagship' species for programs aimed at
					conserving terrestrial invertebrates. Small litter sizes, long generation times and low survivorship among sexually
					immature females contribute to a low rate of population increase for most scorpions. Many scorpion species are also
					extremely habitat specific and range-restricted, exacerbating their risk of extinction due to human activities.
					Increasingly threatened by habitat destruction and harvesting for the souvenir and exotic pet trades, few scorpions
					receive formal protection and many may disappear before being described. For example, ca. 105,000 live <i>Pandinus
					imperator</i> are exported annually from three West African countries to pet shops in Europe, the USA and Japan,
					indicating the magnitude of trade in this particular species, which is now CITES-listed. At least 50 other scorpion
					species, originating from various African, Asian, and American countries, are offered for sale on the exotic pet
					market; the most sought after fetch up to $300 each. Few scorpions receive formal protection and many may disappear
					before being described. The threats faced by many scorpion species renders the task of inventorying their diversity
					and distribution a priority if steps towards their conservation are to be implemented.</p>

				<h4 class="more-space-before">Dwindling Expertise</h4>
				<p>Surprisingly, despite their notoriety, worldwide distribution, medical, ecological and conservation importance,
					scorpions are poorly studied taxonomically. Many families and genera have never been revised and recent inventories
					of scorpion diversity-even in regions thought to be well-surveyed for scorpions (e.g. Australia, southern Africa,
					and the USA) continue to uncover new species and distribution records. Given the paucity of active specialists and
					an aging demographic, it seems unlikely that the world scorpion fauna will become better known until more scorpion
					specialists are trained and the prospects for their employment improve. Our group is addressing this problem by
					coordinating existing expertise in North America to undertake a long overdue revision of the North American scorpion
					family Vaejovidae, and training new specialists in the process.</p>
				<figure class="image-illustration-full">
					<img src="../images/dropinpubs.gif" alt="Drop in publications">
				</figure>
				<h4 class="more-space-before">Model System</h4>
				<p>Scorpions are easy to find in reasonable numbers and thus conducive to the collection of specimens for systematic
					studies and observational data for ecological studies. Because they belong to an ancient lineage, they are
					appropriate for studies of the evolutionary process. The similarity in body form between fossil and modern scorpions
					suggests that their basic habits and habitats may be virtually unchanged since Silurian times. Therefore, knowledge
					about the ecology of extant scorpions allows us to make assumptions about processes and events that may have caused
					scorpion speciation in the past. Most extant scorpions have limited dispersal abilities hence their patterns of
					distribution are amenable to biogeographical analysis.</p>
