<div align="justify">
The Arachnology Lab at the AMNH focuses on the taxonomy, phylogeny and biogeography of scorpions and related 
arachnid orders. There are many compelling reasons to study these organisms. Scorpions and their kin are ancient, medically important, 
ecologically, morphologically and taxonomically diverse, and distributed in most terrestrial habitats and elevations on all continents 
except Antarctica. Scorpions inspire fear and fascination. Many species are threatened yet little is known about their biology, new species 
remain to be discovered, and there are few experts globally. The world scorpion fauna will remain poorly known until more scorpion 
specialists are trained and prospects for their employment improve.

<br /><br />
<b>Diversity:</b> As listed in the Synopsis of Described Scorpions of the World  and the Scorpion Files, approximately 2259 extant species 
in 209 genera and, depending on the authority, between 13 and 20 families (depending on the authority), as well as 92 extinct species in 
71 genera and 42 families, are recognized in the arachnid order Scorpiones. This is an almost fourfold increase in the number of species 
listed a century ago in Kraepelin's (1899) Revision der Skorpione. Although comprising only a small component of arthropod diversity, 
scorpions are of considerable interest to scientist and layman alike.

<br /><br />
<b>Antiquity:</b> Scorpions enjoy widespread public appeal (much of it based on fear). Their toxicity, relatively large size and fearsome 
appearance, notwithstanding the great age of their lineage, contribute to a fascination that has always and continues to surround them. 
Among the most ancient arthropods, derived from amphibious ancestors that lived in the Silurian, more than 400 million years ago, scorpions 
have earned the title of 'living fossils'. The scorpion ground plan, developed so long ago, is highly successful. Paleozoic scorpions 
closely resemble their modern descendants in basic anatomical details, except that some were considerably larger. <i>Brontoscorpio anglicus</i> 
measured approximately 1 meter in length-an order of magnitude greater than the largest extant <i>Pandinus</i> from tropical Africa, which average 
about 20 cm. Scorpions were formerly considered the sister group of other arachnids because they closely resemble extinct marine 
eurypterids (the sister group of arachnids) but recent data suggest that scorpions are embedded in the arachnid lineage, and merely retain 
primitive features.
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="https://research.amnh.org/users/lorenzo/img/venom.gif" alt="venom drop coming out of the aculeus" /></div>
<br /><br />
<b>Notoriety:</b> Scorpions are notorious worldwide. Scorpion venoms contain multiple low molecular weight proteinaceous neurotoxins that 
block sodium and potassium channels, preventing the transmission of nerve impulses across synapses. In regions where scorpion envenomation 
represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality (e.g. Mexico, North Africa and the Middle East), scorpions are justifiably feared. 
Some 100 000 scorpion stings occur annually in Mexico and as many as 800 people (mostly young children and the elderly) die as a result. The 
figures may be even higher in North Africa and the Middle East. Nevertheless, most scorpions are harmless. The sting may be painful, but not 
dangerous. Only about 25 species, all in family Buthidae, are considered medically important worldwide. Most of these occur in the New World 
genera <i>Centruroides</i> and <i>Tityus</i>, and the Old World genera <i>Androctonus</i>, <i>Buthus</i>, <i>Leiurus</i>, <i>Mesobuthus</i> and <i>Parabuthus</i>. <i>Centruroides exilicauda</i>, 
from Arizona, California, and New Mexico, is the only species known to be lethal in the U.S.A. The venom of these scorpions has proved fatal 
to healthy children up to 16 years of age and to adults suffering from hypertension and general debility. 
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="https://research.amnh.org/users/lorenzo/img/distribution.jpg" alt="approximate world distribution of scorpions" /></div>
<br /><br />
<b>Distribution:</b> Scorpions occur on all continents except Antarctica, but are most abundant and diverse in tropical and subtropical 
regions. The greatest abundance and diversity of scorpions occurs in desert and semi-desert habitats, but they may also be found in savannas 
and grasslands, in deciduous, coniferous, and tropical rainforests, on high mountain slopes (above 5500 m elevation) in the Alps, Himalayas 
and Andes, in some of the deepest caves (nearly 1 km below the surface), and even in the intertidal zone. Although most scorpions are 
terrestrial, some are arboreal. Favored habitats include burrows (up to 1 m deep, to escape hot diurnal temperatures), spaces under tree 
bark, logs, stones, and in rock crevices. Some species adapt well to human environments. Scorpions are often abundant in suitable habitat. 
Densities of 1 per square meter were reported for the Middle Eastern <i>Leiurus quinquestriatus</i> and of 8-12 per square meter for the intertidal 
<i>Serradigitus littoralis</i> from Baja California. Given the high densities of scorpions in some areas, their importance in ecological food 
webs, particularly with respect to helping control insect populations, is considerable. Many are sensitive to environmental degradation 
and are considered equilibrium species.

<br /><br />
<b>Ecology:</b> Scorpions are primarily nocturnal. All fluoresce under long-wave ultraviolet light, facilitating their collection and 
observation at night. Their simple eyes detect luminosity, but little else. Prey are detected with slit sense organs in the tarsi, sensory 
setae (trichobothria) on the pedipalps, and the pectines, and attacked with the chelate pedipalps or venomous sting. Scorpions with slender 
pedipalps are prone to sting their prey, those with robust pedipalps to crush prey mechanically, reserving the sting for large or strong 
prey. All use the pedipalps to manipulate prey, tearing pieces off with the chelicerae to be digested in a pre-oral cavity before being 
sucked into the gut. Scorpions are important consumers in some communities. <i>Scorpio maurus</i> was reported to eat an annual average of 11% of 
the Israeli isopod population, <i>Urodacus yaschenkoi</i> 7.9 kg/ha of invertebrate prey in Australia. Cannibalism and predation by other scorpion 
species may be the most important sources of scorpion mortality but other invertebrate predators (e.g. centipedes) and vertebrates are also 
important predators. Mortality is highest immediately after birth, lower for individuals of intermediate age, and high for adults. For 
example, 65%, 30%, and 60% per year for the Australian <i>Urodacus manicatus</i>. Mortality is particularly high among males due to increased 
mobility during breeding season and cannibalism by females. Biased adult sex ratios of 1.2-1.4:1 are typical. Social behavior occurs 
rarely in species of <i>Heterometrus</i>, <i>Opisthacanthus</i> and <i>Pandinus</i>, in which family groups with overlapping generations cooperate to construct 
and occupy communal burrows, inhabited by individuals of various ages.

<br /><br />
<b>Life History:</b> Scorpions have a remarkable life history. Reproduction in scorpions is indirect. Intromission occurs via a 
spermatophore. The male attaches the spermatophore to the substrate while grasping the female by the pedipalps or chelicerae during a 
mating dance or "promenade-&agrave;-deux". The species-specific spermatophore catapults the sperm mass into the female gonopore when a lever is 
touched (a lock-and-key mechanism). Scorpions are unusual among arthropods in that all are viviparous-embryos develop in the reproductive 
tract and receive nourishment from yolk or maternal tissues. Some are parthenogenic. More than most other terrestrial arthropods, scorpions 
resemble large vertebrates in life history traits and are considered K-selected. They have very low reproductive rates in comparison to 
other terrestrial arthropods and are among the most long-lived. Gestation times are long (several months to more than a year) and litter 
sizes often small (1-105). Young are fairly large at birth and altricial, clinging to the mother for the first few molts before 
dispersing. Time to sexual maturity varying from 2-8 years, depending on the species. Average longevity is around 4 years, but larger 
species may live 25-30 years. Scorpions do not molt as adults.

<br /><br />
<b>Conservation:</b> Urgency for the study of any taxonomic group can be argued on the basis of prevailing ignorance about the world's 
biota. However, scorpions warrant more attention than they receive. As K-selected, equilibrium species, and comprising a major group of 
predatory arthropods in arid ecosystems, scorpions are valuable bio-indicators. Their disappearance signals habitat degradation and they 
represent charismatic 'flagship' species for programs aimed at conserving terrestrial invertebrates. Small litter sizes, long generation 
times and low survivorship among sexually immature females contribute to a low rate of population increase for most scorpions. Many 
scorpion species are also extremely habitat specific and range-restricted, exacerbating their risk of extinction due to human activities. 
Increasingly threatened by habitat destruction and harvesting for the souvenir and exotic pet trades, few scorpions receive formal 
protection and many may disappear before being described. For example, ca. 105,000 live <i>Pandinus imperator</i> are exported annually from 
three West African countries to pet shops in Europe, the USA and Japan, indicating the magnitude of trade in this particular species, 
which is now CITES-listed. At least 50 other scorpion species, originating from various African, Asian, and American countries, are 
offered for sale on the exotic pet market; the most sought after fetch up to $300 each. Few scorpions receive formal protection and many 
may disappear before being described. The threats faced by many scorpion species renders the task of inventorying their diversity and 
distribution a priority if steps towards their conservation are to be implemented.

<br /><br />
<b>Dwindling Expertise:</b> Surprisingly, despite their notoriety, worldwide distribution, medical, ecological and conservation 
importance, scorpions are poorly studied taxonomically. Many families and genera have never been revised and recent inventories of 
scorpion diversity-even in regions thought to be well-surveyed for scorpions (e.g. Australia, southern Africa, and the USA) continue to 
uncover new species and distribution records. Given the paucity of active specialists and an aging demographic, it seems unlikely that 
the world scorpion fauna will become better known until more scorpion specialists are trained and the prospects for their employment 
improve. Our group is addressing this problem by coordinating existing expertise in North America to undertake a long overdue revision of 
the North American scorpion family Vaejovidae, and training new specialists in the process.
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="https://research.amnh.org/users/lorenzo/img/dropinpubs.gif" alt="drop in publications" /></div>
<br /><br />
<b>Model System:</b> Scorpions are easy to find in reasonable numbers and thus conducive to the collection of specimens for systematic 
studies and observational data for ecological studies. Because they belong to an ancient lineage, they are appropriate for studies of the 
evolutionary process. The similarity in body form between fossil and modern scorpions suggests that their basic habits and habitats may 
be virtually unchanged since Silurian times. Therefore, knowledge about the ecology of extant scorpions allows us to make assumptions 
about processes and events that may have caused scorpion speciation in the past. Most extant scorpions have limited dispersal abilities 
hence their patterns of distribution are amenable to biogeographical analysis.
